The water test system contains spherical systems of water of various sizes. In addition
they contain mono-ionic systems to test the polarisation scheme. These tests are important
for unity amongst physical observables from the SCAAS model, but also provide insight in the
scalability of the code (and is thus useful to benchmark your hardware).

Each system is subject to 10 ps of sampling time. Simulations are started at 300K, using
random velocities generated at the same speed from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

Included tests

- Water spheres ranging from 10 to 30 A in 5 A increments.
- Solvated Sodium and Chlorine ion in same systems.

- Input topology files are generated with Q5.07
